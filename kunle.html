<ul>
    
    <strong>Step 1</strong>
    <li>Mix flour, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Beat eggs in a second medium bowl until frothy. Place bread crumbs in a third bowl.
    </li>
    <strong>Step 2</strong>
    <li>Dredge shrimp in the flour mixture, then shake off excess. Dip shrimp into beaten eggs, then press shrimp into bread crumbs, turning to coat both sides.</li>
   <strong>Step 3</strong>
    <li>Heat 2 inches oil in a large, heavy pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

    </li>
   <strong>Step 4</strong>
    <li>Deep-fry shrimp in batches in the hot oil until cooked through, about 1 minute. Use tongs to transfer shrimp to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat to cook remaining shrimp.

    </li>
    <strong>Step 5</strong>
    <li>Arrange shrimp on a platter to serve.</li>
